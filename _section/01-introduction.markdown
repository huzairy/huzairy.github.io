What you see here is a single page HTML file generated by [Codex](https://github.com/huzairy/codex "Single page Jekyll build") + [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/huzairy/huzairy.github.io), which I refer as my online codex. The beauty of single page document: fast, can be viewed offline, and you can search anything in real-time using the built-in browser's search function.

Feel free to use or download this codex. If I may, I would recommend all web designer/developer to have their own codex so that we can learn from each other through knowledge sharing, which is really cool in my opinion.
