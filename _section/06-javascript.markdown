JavaScript is one of the three things web designer/developer should know after HTML and CSS. Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a programming language. Mainly used to control the behavior of the website.

If you want to learn the basic of JavaScript, please enroll in [Codecademy free JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) course. Highly recommended.

### JavaScript frameworks, libraries & plugins I regularly hardly use:

* [Node.Js](http://nodejs.org/) : In a nutshell, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime library installed on your computer, or server.
* [Grunt.Js](http://gruntjs.com/) : The JavaScript task runner. Require Node Package Manager to install.
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) : A little language that compiles into JavaScript.
* [Angular.Js](https://angularjs.org/) : Just another JavaScript framework to build web application.
* [Ember.Js](http://emberjs.com/) : Same as above.
* [Handlebars.Js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) : A templating engine, an alternatives to [Mustache.Js](https://mustache.github.io/), and [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/).
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) : JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) : A very popular JavaScript library for web designer/developer.
* [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) : Awesome and easy to use JavaScript grid layout library.
* [Google Prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) : Syntax highlighting on HTML.
* [Highlight.Js](https://highlightjs.org/) : Same as above.

**Note:** I'm using [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) to load JavaScript library/plugin that I need.
